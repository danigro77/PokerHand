Poker Hands

Input: a string-encoded hand of cards
Output: All of the hand rankings

For example:
> hands(“AC AD 7H 5D 5H”)
> [“two pair”, “high card: AC”]

another example:
> hands(“AC 4D 7H 5D 6C”)
> [“high card: AC”]

A card is encoded as “[face][suit]” where suits are:
C - Clubs
D - Diamonds
S - Spades
H - Hearts

The string encoding for face is:
2 through 10
A - Ace
K - King
Q - Queen
J - Jack

For a list of poker hands and their rules see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands

To keep the scope down only consider the following hands:
Straight flush
Four of a kind
Flush
Straight
Three of a kind
Two pair
One pair
High card


What I’m looking for:
